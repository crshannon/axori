      "shortDefinition": "A tax deduction for the wear and tear on your property over time, allowing you to reduce taxable income without spending cash.",
      "fullDefinition": "Depreciation is a non-cash tax deduction that allows you to write off the cost of a building over its useful life (27.5 years for residential, 39 years for commercial). This 'phantom expense' reduces your taxable income even though you're not actually spending money. The building (not land) portion of your purchase price is divided by the depreciation period to determine your annual deduction. Depreciation is one of the most powerful tax benefits of real estate investing.",
