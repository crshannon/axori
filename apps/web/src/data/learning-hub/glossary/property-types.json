      "fullDefinition": "A Single Family Residence (SFR) is a standalone house designed for one household. SFRs are the most common entry point for new investors because they're familiar, easier to finance, and have a large buyer pool when you sell. They typically appreciate well and attract longer-term tenants (families). The downside is lower cash flow compared to multifamily since you're only collecting one rent check.",

      "fullDefinition": "Small multifamily properties (2-4 units) offer the best of both worlds: multiple income streams like commercial properties, but with residential financing (better rates, lower down payments if owner-occupied). Duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes are ideal for house hacking and provide natural vacancy protection—one empty unit doesn't mean zero income. They're often the sweet spot for growing investors.",
